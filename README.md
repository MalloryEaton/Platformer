# Platformer
https://github.com/MalloryEaton/Platformer.git

This is a 2D platformer game that we have decided to call "Super Kirbario" since it's theme is Kirby but it plays like Mario.
Play through the levels as Kirbario, killing enemies and collecting coins as you go. The quicker you get throught the levels, the more time bonus you get at the end of the game. You can also gain points by collecting all of the coins and killing all of the enemies.

Kirbario is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard:
    up = jump
    down = turn to stone, which is used to kill enemies
    left = move left
    right = move right
    space = go through the door at the end of the level
    
I don't know of any bugs.

What each person contributed:
  Sam: Reading in of levels; enemy movement, spritesheets, collision, etc; parallax background; everything about the coins; making the timer/score/lives move correctly on the screen; timer; cleaning of code to make it more OOP-like
  Mallory: Everything else
  
Percentage:
Mallory ? / Sam ?
